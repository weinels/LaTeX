\begin{syllabusitem}{General Education Statement}
This course fulfills the #1 requirement for the General Education Program at Salt Lake Community College. It is designed not only to teach the information and skills required by the discipline, but also to develop vital workplace skills and to teach strategies and skills that can be used for life-long learning. General Education courses teach basic skills as well as broaden a student's knowledge of a wide range of subjects. 

\vspace{0.5cm}
\emph{Education is much more than the acquisition of facts; it is being able to use information in meaningful ways in order to enrich one's life.} While the subject of each course is important and useful, we become truly educated through making connections of such varied information with the different methods of organizing human experience that are practiced by different disciplines. Therefore, this course, when combined with other General Education courses, will enable you to develop broader perspectives and deeper understandings of your community and the world, as well as challenge previously held assumptions about the world and its inhabitants.
\end{syllabusitem}

\begin{syllabusitem}{General Education e-Portfolios}
Each student in General Education courses at SLCC maintains a General Education ePortfolio. Instructors in every Gen Ed course will ask you to put at least one assignment from the course into your ePortfolio, and accompany it with reflective writing. It is a requirement in this class for you to add to your ePortfolio. Your ePortfolio will allow you to include your educational goals, describe your extracurricular activities, and post your resume. When you finish your time at SLCC, your ePortfolio will then be a multi-media showcase of your educational experience.   New ePortfolio Introduction Video.  

\vspace{0.5cm}
This good three-minute video for you to watch: \url{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pn3AAts1-4} 

\vspace{0.5cm}
Salt Lake Community College and Utah Valley University have jointly adopted Digication as the default ePortfolio tool for all students. New students will use Digication for ePortfolio creation, but most students have a Web 2.0 portfolio they already created. \textbf{If you already have an established portfolio we will not be asking you to change to Digication.} If you have an existing portfolio with rich content in it, keep it and keep working to improve it as a showcase of your learning. If you haven't yet started an ePortfolio, start one with Digication. If you have an existing portfolio with very little in it, consider moving that content to a Digication portfolio.
